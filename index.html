The heating cable is ordered in specific lengths and cannot be cut or stretched. Installation requires a prescribed spacing to effectively warm your feet and is controlled by embedded sensors connected to a programmable thermostat. In this install, you might be able to follow the path of the cable as it starts near the door and finishes beside the soon-to-be-installed soaker tub (beside the pictured vacuum hose).";

Decoupling improves the long term viability of the tile installation since it is not directly connected to a wood product that changes dimensions with humidity levels. The levelling clips provide consistent spacing and ensures tile to tile transitions are smooth. This is a fairly large format tile that required extra care to install.";

The shower featured 4 jets, a wand and a rain-hat with Delta thermostatic mixing valve. The valve was placed within reach of the door so that the homeowner could call for warm water without immediately getting splashed with cold water.

The joists are made from 2x8 treated lumber and will be covered along the top edge by a plastic clipping system for the deck boards.

When ready, concrete with a 19mm aggregate is pumped into the structure. Pictured above you can see a number of steel braces installed on the inner wall. These braces ensure plumb walls and provide installers with the needed scaffolding from which they can safely work. The results are slightly more expensive than traditional methods, but there are a growing list of benefits that builders and home owners should consider.";

If you are looking to build an energy efficient home, we think you should consider ICF for your structure."
